A program aiming to make it easy to change power mode manully like power-profiles-daemon, but basing op TLP.
Only systemd init is supported. For other init, please start tlp-switch-daemon by root.
If anyone writes scipts to make it work in other inits please tell me.

Configure files are in /etc/tlp.d

Use tlp-switch with root permission to add, change or delete power mode configures.
Use tlp-switch with root permission to list or switch to different power mode.
Use tlp-switch without root permission to list or switch to different power mode when daemon is running.
